= Dependent Typestates <ch:13_bitvectors>

```fluxhidden
use std::{
  mem::replace,
  sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering}, vec,
};

use flux_rs::{
    assert, alias, constant, defs, detached_spec, extern_spec, invariant, opaque, refined_by, reflect, spec, specs, trusted,
    bitvec::BV32;
};
```


Our next case study shows how Flux's refinements
can be used to make the _typestate_ even more
expressive by connecting typestates with run-time
values to avoiding the blowup that ensues from
using (only) Rust's types
//
#footnote[See https://www.ecorax.net/macro-bunker-1/]
//
while still providing compile-time correctness guarantees.
//
Lets explore this idea by building a library
to manipulate GPIO pins on embedded hardware
where each _port_ comprises multiple _pins_
each of which can be set to be in `Input` or
`Output` mode, and must be used according to
its current mode.

== Bitvectors

The pins' modes will be configured and accessed
via _bitwise_ operations on dedicated hardware
registers.
//
Flux lets us precisely track the results of bitwise
operations --- just like we can track arithmetic
operations (@ch:02_refinements) or set operations
(@ch:12_sets) --- with a special `flux_rs::bitvec::BV32`
type that represents 32-bit bitvectors as an _opaque_
(see @ch:06_vectors) newtype wrapper around `u32`
indexed by a `bitvec<32>` that tracks the bits
of the underlying `u32`
//
#footnote[Flux also supports `BV8`, `BV16` and `BV64`
types for 8-, 16- and 64-bit bitvectors, but lets focus
on `BV32` for simplicity].


```rust
#[refined_by(x: bitvec<32>)]        // bitvector-valued index
pub struct BV32(u32);
```

=== Creating and Operating on Bitvectors

// *Creating Bitvectors*
The API for `BV32` has methods to convert from and to `u32`
whose refine contracts use the _logical functions_ `bv_int_to_bv32`
and `bv_bv32_to_int` to convert between the `int` index (of the `u32`)
and its `bitvec<32>` representation (of the `BV32`).


```rs
impl BV32 {
  #[spec(fn(value: u32) -> BV32[bv_int_to_bv32(value)])]
  pub fn new(value: u32) -> BV32 { BV32(value) }
}
```

```rs
impl Into<u32> for BV32 {
  #[spec(fn(self:BV32) -> u32[bv_bv32_to_int(self)])]
  pub fn into(self) -> u32 { self.0 }
}
```



*Bitvector Operations* The `flux_rs::bitvec` library implements
the various traits like `BitAnd`, `BitOr`, `Not`, `Shl`, `Shr`,
_etc._ to enable bitwise operations on `BV32` values.
//
For example, the _left-shift_ (`<<`) operation is implemented as

```rust
impl Shl<u32> for BV32 {
  #[spec(fn(self, rhs: u32) -> BV32[self << bv_int_to_bv32(rhs)])]
  fn shl(self, rhs: u32) -> BV32 { BV32(self.0 << rhs) }
}
```

and the bitwise or (`|`) operation is implemented as

```rust
impl BitOr for BV32 {
  #[spec(fn(self, rhs: BV32) -> BV32[self | rhs])]
  fn bitor(self, rhs: BV32) -> BV32 { BV32(self.0 | rhs.0) }
}
```

#alert("success", [
*EXERCISE:* Lets test our operators out: can you fix the code below so the `assert` is verified by Flux?
])

```flux
#[spec(fn () -> u32[10])]
fn test_shl_or() {
  let b1 = BV32::new(1);  // 0b0001
  let b5 = BV32::new(5);  // 0b0101
  let res = b5 << b1;     // 0b1010
  let res = res | b1;     // 0b1011
  res.into()
}
```


=== Getting and Setting Individual Bits

Next, lets use the bitwise operations to write functions that _get_
or _set_ a bit at a particular position in a `BV32`.

*Valid Bit Positions*
//
Lets first write an alias for valid bit positions (`0` to `31`)

```flux
#[alias(type Pin = u8{n: 0 <= n && n < 32})]
type Pin = u8;
```

Note that while `rustc` will allow any `u8` value to be used as a `Pin`,
Flux will complain if we try to use a value outside the valid range.

*Getting the Value of a Pin*
//
We can now write a function that _gets_
the value of a `BV32` at a given position
by returning `true` if the bit is set to `1`
and `false` otherwise.

```flux
fn get_pin(bv: BV32, pin: Pin) -> bool {
    let b1 = 1; // const promotion
    ((bv >> pin) & 1) == b1
}
```

*Setting the Value of a Pin*
//
Similarly, we can write a function that takes as input a `bool`
and _sets_ the bit at the given position to `1` if the `bool` is `true`
and to `0` otherwise.

```flux
fn set_pin(bv:BV32, pin:Pin, b:bool) -> BV32 {
    if b {
        bv | (BV32::new(1) << pin)
    } else {
        bv & !(BV32::new(1) << pin)
    }
}
```

*Refinement-Level Get/Set Functions*
//
To verify code that _uses_ `get_pin` and `set_pin`, we need to specify
their behavior using Flux contracts. The most direct way to do so is
to write _refinement functions_ (see @ch:04_structs:refinement-functions)
like `get_pin`, defined below

```flux
defs! {
    fn get_pin(bv: bitvec<32>, pin: int) -> bool{
        let val = (bv >> bv_int_to_bv32(pin)) & 1;
        val == 1
    }
}
```

and `set_pin` which is similarly defined as shown below

```flux
defs! {
    fn set_pin(bv: bitvec<32>, pin: int, val: bool) -> bitvec<32> {
        let index_bits = bv_int_to_bv32(pin);
        if val {
            bv | (1 << index_bits)
        } else {
            bv & bv_not(1 << index_bits)
        }
    }
}
```

#alert("info", [
*Syntax:* While we have tried to make the syntax of
the _refinement function_ `set_pin` shown above
_look like_ the implementation of the Rust method
of the same name, they are not the same thing.
Indeed, notice we wrote `bv_not` instead of `!`
in the refinement function as `!` is reserved
for boolean negation inside refinement expressions.
])

*Connecting Rust Methods with Refinement Functions*
//
Once we have defined the refinement functions, we can
use them to specify the output types of the corresponding
Rust functions, using detached specifications (see @ch:11_equality:detached).

```flux
detached_spec! {
  fn get_pin(bv: BV32, pin: Pin) -> bool[get_pin(bv, pin)];
  fn set_pin(bv: BV32, pin: Pin, b: bool) -> BV32[set_pin(bv, pin, b)];
}
```

We can confirm that the specifications for the above are correctly tracking
the bits via the following test:

```flux
fn test_get_set_pin() {
  let b5 = BV32::new(5);            // 0b0101
  flux_rs::assert(get_pin(b5, 2));  // bit 2 is set
  let b5 = set_pin(b5, 2, false);   // 0b0001
  flux_rs::assert(!get_pin(b5, 2)); // bit 2 is cleared
}
```

== GPIO Ports

Lets tuck the newly learned information about bitvectors into our pockets
and now turn to the issue at hand: developing an API for interacting
with _General Purpose Input/Output_ (GPIO) _ports_ in low-level embedded
microcontrollers.

*Ports and Pins* GPIO ports are the conduit through
which microcontrollers "talk" to the external world,
_e.g._ to read sensors that determine key-presses
or light up output LEDs.
//
GPIO ports, are themselves collections of _pins_ that
can be configured individually as either `Input` or `Output`,
and which can then be read from or written to accordingly.
//
The developer must take care to use each pin according
to how it's mode was configured, as otherwise the hardware
may produce invalid data or worse, may destroy the hardware
by releasing its "magic smoke"
#footnote[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_smoke]!

*Registers*
//
In common hardware platforms like the STM32, ports are
controlled via dedicated _memory mapped port registers_
which control the modes and input and output values of _all_
the pins in that port, where the i#super[th] bit in the
register corresponds to the i#super[th] pin of the port.
//
We can model such registers in Rust as

```flux
#[repr(C)]
struct Registers {
  modes: BV32, // Bit 0 = pin 0 mode, bit 1 = pin 1 mode, etc.
  output: u32, // Bit 0 = pin 0 output, bit 1 = pin 1 output, etc.
  input: u32,  // Bit 0 = pin 0 input, bit 1 = pin 1 input, etc.
}
```

and then the GPIO port itself is a wrapper around a pointer
to such registers

```flux
struct Gpio(*mut Registers);
```


== Tracking Modes

If you are well-caffeinated, you may have noticed that we used the `BV32`
type for the `modes` register in `Registers` struct above, as it will let
us index the `struct Registers` with a `bitvec<32>` that tracks the modes
of all 32 pins in the GPIO port.

```flux
detached_spec! {
  #[refined_by(modes: bitvec<32>)]
  struct Registers {
    modes: BV32[modes],
    output: u32,
    input: u32,
  }
}
```

Similarly, lets refine `struct Gpio` to track the `modes` of the `Registers`
that it _points to_

```flux
  #[refined_by(modes: bitvec<32>)]
  #[opaque] struct Gpio;
}
```

*Private Trusted API*
As the actual `Registers` must be accessed directly via `unsafe` pointer
dereferences, we mark the `struct` as `opaque` (see @ch:06_vectors) and
write a small suite of _private_ `trusted` (_i.e._ unverified) methods
for the `unsafe` dereferences, that we will then use to
to build a verified _public_ API for port access.

```flux
#[trusted]
impl Gpio {
    #[spec(fn(&Gpio[@modes]) -> &Registers[modes])]
    fn get_registers(&self) -> &Registers {
        unsafe { &*self.0 }
    }

    #[spec(fn(self: &mut Gpio, m: BV32) ensures self: Gpio[m])]
    fn set_modes(&mut self, m: BV32) {
        unsafe { (&mut *self.0).modes = m}
    }

    #[spec(fn(self:&mut Gpio[@m], output:u32) ensures self: Gpio[m])]
    fn set_output(&mut self, output: u32) {
        unsafe { (&mut *self.0).output = output }
    }
}
```

The `get_registers` dereferences the pointer stashed inside the `Gpio` to
return a `Registers` that has exactly the same `modes`.
//
Dually, the `set_modes` updates the `modes` of the underlying `Registers`
with the given value, updating the refinement of the `Gpio` accordingly.
//
Finally, the `set_output` updates the `output` register pointed to by the `Gpio`
but leaves the `modes` unchanged.

*Peripherals* Finally, we can bundle multiple GPIO ports into a `Peripherals`
struct that represents all the hardware peripherals of a microcontroller.

```flux
struct Peripherals { gpio_a: Gpio, gpio_b: Gpio, gpio_c: Gpio }
```

We can then provide safe singleton access to the peripherals
via a `take_peripherals` function that maps the actual addresses
of the hardware registers to `Gpio` instances.

```flux
#[trusted]
fn take_peripherals() -> Option<Peripherals> {
  static TAKEN: AtomicBool = AtomicBool::new(false);
  if TAKEN
     .compare_exchange(false, true, Ordering::SeqCst, Ordering::SeqCst)
     .is_ok()
  { Some(Peripherals {
        gpio_a: Gpio(0x4800_0000 as *mut Registers),
        gpio_b: Gpio(0x4800_0400 as *mut Registers),
        gpio_c: Gpio(0x4800_0800 as *mut Registers),
    })
  } else { None }
}
```



== Using Modes

Next, lets use the private methods to implement a public API for GPIO
access that _gets_ and _sets_ a pin's modes, and ensures it is used
according to its mode. First, lets write an `enum` to represent the
modes of a `Pin`

```flux
#[reflect] #[derive(PartialEq, Eq)]
enum Mode { Input, Output }
flux_core::eq!(Mode);
```

We _could_ have just used `bool` but sadly, I kept mixing up
whether `true` meant `Input` or `Output`.
//
An `enum` rather dispels the confusion!
//
However it will be quite convenient to convert between
`Mode` and `bool` with two helper functions

```flux
impl From<bool> for Mode {
    #[spec(fn (b: bool) -> Mode[bool_to_mode(b)])]
    fn from(b: bool) -> Self {
        if b { Mode::Output } else { Mode::Input }
    }
}
impl Into<bool> for Mode {
    #[spec(fn (mode: Mode) -> bool[mode_to_bool(mode)])]
    fn into(self) -> bool {
        match self {
            Mode::Output => true,
            Mode::Input => false,
        }
    }
}
```

whose specifications use the refinement functions

```flux
defs! {
  fn bool_to_mode(b:bool) -> Mode {
    if b {
        Mode::Output
    } else {
        Mode::Input
    }
  }

  fn mode_to_bool(mode: Mode) -> bool {
    mode == Mode::Output
  }
}
```

*Getting the Mode* Lets use the private API and the bitvector
helpers to implement a public method to get a `Pin`'s
mode, using `get_pin` defined earlier plus the `Mode`-`bool`
conversion.


```flux
impl Gpio {
  #[spec(fn(&Gpio[@modes], pin: Pin) -> Mode[get_mode(modes, pin)])]
  pub fn get_mode(&self, pin: Pin) -> Mode {
    Mode::from(get_pin(self.get_registers().modes, pin))
  }
}
```

where the specification function `get_mode` is just

```flux
defs! {
    fn get_mode(bv: bitvec<32>, index: int) -> Mode {
        bool_to_mode(get_pin(bv, index))
    }
}
```

*Setting the Mode* Similarly, we can implement a public method to set
a `Pin`'s mode using `set_pin` defined earlier plus the `Mode`-`bool`
conversion.

```flux
impl Gpio {
  // #[spec(EXERCISE)]
  pub fn set_mode(&mut self, pin: Pin, mode: Mode) {
    let regs = self.get_registers();
    self.set_modes(set_pin(regs.modes, pin, mode.into()))
  }
}
```

#alert("success", [
*EXERCISE:* Write the specification for `set_mode` so Flux verifies
`test_get_set`.
// is verified by Flux. You may
// need to define a _refinement function_ similar to `get_mode`.
])

```flux
#[spec(fn(gpio: &mut Gpio[@modes]) ensures gpio: Gpio[modes])]
fn test_get_set(gpio: &mut Gpio) {
    let orig = gpio.get_mode(3);        // save original mode
    let out = Mode::Output;
    gpio.set_mode(3, out);              // set to output
    assert(gpio.get_mode(3) == out);    // const promotion
    gpio.set_mode(3, orig_mode);        // restore original mode
}
```

*Input and Output Pins* We want the methods that
read from and write to a `Pin` to only be invoked
on pins that are configured to be in `Input` or
`Output` mode respectively. First, lets write a
type _alias_ for such pins (as always, paired
with a matching Rust-level alias that can be
used in Rust signatures.)

```flux
#[alias(type In(m:bitvec<32>) = Pin{v:get_mode(m, v) == Mode::Input})]
type In = Pin;

#[alias(type Out(m:bitvec<32>) = Pin{v:get_mode(m, v) == Mode::Output})]
type Out = Pin;
```

#alert("info", [
*Dependent Aliases*: Unlike the definition of `Pin` which
is simply a `u8` between `0` and `32`, the definitions of
the aliases `In` and `Out` _depend on_ the `bitvec<32>` index `m`.
//
This is essential as actual _mode_ is stored
in the `modes` register and not the `Pin` itself.
//
Flux supports such _dependent aliases_ with
_alias parameters_ like `m: bitvec<32>` that
can be used in the alias body, and which must
then be supplied wherever the aliases are used
in Flux specifications.
])


*Reading & Writing Pins* Finally, lets use the alias to write
`read` and `write` methods that only accept `In` and `Out`
pins, respectively

```flux
impl Gpio {
    #[spec(fn(&Gpio[@modes], pin: In(modes)) -> bool)]
    pub fn read(&self, pin: In) -> bool {
        let regs = self.get_registers();
        get_pin(regs.input.into(), pin)
    }

    #[spec(fn(self: &mut Gpio[@modes], pin: Out(modes), value: bool))]
    pub fn write(&mut self, pin: Out, value: bool) {
        let output = self.get_registers().output.into();
        let new_output = set_pin(output, pin, value).into();;
        self.set_output(new_output);
    }
}
```

Well then, we now have a complete API to
determine and configure the modes of each
pin, and read and write them according to
their enabled modes, such that that Flux
can statically ensure that the "magic smoke"
stays inside!

== Clients

Lets test our API out with some example client code.

*Reading and Writing Pins* Here's an example that illustrates
how we can use our GPIO API to configure and access different
pins on different ports.
//
First, we get mutable access to the GPIO ports via the
`take_peripherals` function.
//
Next, we configure some pins as `Output` and others as `Input`.
Flux will use the specification for `set_mode` to track each
of the pins' modes separately (in the `modes` index for `gpio_a`
and `gpio_b`).
//
Consequently, Flux will allow us to `read` from the `Input` pins,
and `write` to the `Input` pins.
//
However, Flux will prevent you from trying to
`read` from or `write` to an `Output` or `Input`
pin, respectively, as you can see by uncommenting the lines
at the bottom of the function.


```flux
fn test_read_write() {
    // Get mutable access to GPIOA
    let mut peripherals = take_peripherals().expect("taken!");
    let gpio_a = &mut peripherals.gpio_a;
    let gpio_b = &mut peripherals.gpio_b;

    // Different pins, different states
    gpio_a.set_mode(0, Mode::Output); // PA0 : Out
    gpio_a.set_mode(1, Mode::Output); // PA1 : Out
    gpio_a.set_mode(5, Mode::Input);  // PA5 : In
    gpio_b.set_mode(0, Mode::Input);  // PB3 = In

    // Valid accesses
    gpio_a.write(0, true);
    gpio_a.write(1, true);
    let button_state = gpio_a.read(5);
    let timer_state = gpio_b.read(0);

    // Invalid accesses caught at compile-time
    // gpio_a.read(0);         // ERROR! Can't read from Out pin
    // gpio_a.write(5, true);  // ERROR! Can't write to In pin
}
```

*Reading Multiple Pins*
//
Your turn! Consider the function below that takes as input
_sequence_ of Pins, and returns as output a vector of the
`bool` obtained from reading the sequence of `Pins`.

#alert("success", [
*EXERCISE:* Write a `spec` that lets Flux verify `read_pins`.
])

```flux
fn read_pins(gpio: &Gpio, pins: &[Pin]) -> Vec<bool> {
    let mut res = vec![];
    for pin in pins {
        res.push(gpio.read(*pin));
    }
    res
}
```

*Writing Multiple Pins* And here is a similar function that additionally
takes as input a sequence of `bool` values to write to the
corresponding sequence of `Pins`.

#alert("success", [
*EXERCISE:* Write a `spec` that lets Flux verify `write_pins`.
])


```flux
fn write_pins(gpio: &mut Gpio, pins: &[Pin], vals: &[bool]) {
    for i in 0..pins.len() {
        gpio.write(pins[i], vals[i]);
    }
}
```

*Dynamic Mode Configuration*
//
Lets look at an example where we might want to "force" a `Pin` to
`Output` mode, optionally returning its value if it was (previously)
in `Input` mode. Flux will not let us read from a pin until we have
established that the current mode (obtained by `get_mode`) is, in fact,
`Input`. At that point, we can read the pin, and then set it to `Output` mode.
```flux
#[spec(fn(gpio: &mut Gpio, pin:Pin) -> Option<bool> ensures gpio: Gpio)]
fn detect_and_set(gpio: &mut Gpio, pin: Pin) -> Option<bool> {
    // gpio.read(pin); // ERROR can't read, don't know state!
    if let Mode::Input = gpio.get_mode(pin) {
        let val = gpio.read(pin);
        gpio.set_mode(pin, Mode::Output);
        return Some(val);
    }
    None
}
```

*Blinking a Status LED*
//
One often wants an embedded device to blink, _e.g._ to
let us know its alive and kicking. The usual maneuver
is to toggle a dedicated status LED pin inside the main
loop of the application.

#alert("success", [
*EXERCISE:* Fix the spec so Flux verifies `blink_status_led`.
])

```flux
#[spec(fn(gpio: &mut { Gpio[@modes] | true}))]
fn blink_status_led(gpio: &mut Gpio) {
    static mut LED_STATE: bool = true;
    let value = unsafe { LED_STATE = !LED_STATE; LED_STATE };
    gpio.write(13, value); // HINT: When is this ok to call?
}
```

#alert("success", [
*EXERCISE:*
Here's the main "loop"
of an embedded application that blinks the status LED
to indicate the system is alive.
Can you find out why Flux rejects
the call to `blink_status_led`, and remedy mattes
so that `app` is accepted?
])

```flux
fn app() {
    let mut peripherals = take_peripherals().expect("taken!");
    let gpio_c = &mut peripherals.gpio_c;
    // blink_status_led(gpio_c); // ERROR! not yet Output
    detect_and_set(gpio_c, 13); // ensure pin 13 is Output
    loop {
        // let result = process_data(read_sensors());
        // update_outputs(result);
        blink_status_led(gpio_c); // indicate system is alive
    }
}
```

== Summary

In this chapter, we learned about
Flux's support for _bitvector_ valued refinements
via the `BV` type, and how to use bitvectors
to track the modes of GPIO pins,
to write a verified GPIO library
that ensures pins are used per their configuration.

Existing embedded Rust libraries track pin modes
in Rust's using `PhantomData` and the typestate
pattern
#footnote[https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/static-guarantees/state-machines.html].
//
While this approach has the advantage of working
out of the box with plain `rustc`, it has two
drawbacks.
//
First, we get a explosion in the number of types,
and the attendant duplication of methods.
//
Second, and perhaps more importantantly, we end up
tracking the state of the `Pin` at the type-level,
when we really want to track state of the `modes`
register to avoid any shenanigans that might arise
_concurrently_ accessing different pins of the same
port. (The classic typestate approach would end up
having to create 2#super[32] different types
to track all mode configurations of a single port!)

In contrast, Flux's refinements allow us to
compactly track the entire vector of modes
via logical refinements while still providing
compile-time guarantees that each pin is used
according to its configured mode.
